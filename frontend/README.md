## Git Conventions

### Git Messages
Philosophy based off of [Emoji-Log: A new way to write Git commit messages](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/emoji-log-git-commit-messages)

1. Imperative
   * Commit messages should be imperative, like you are giving an order  
     :white_check_mark: **Add** instead of :x: **Added**       
     :white_check_mark: **Create** instead of :x: **Creating**
2. Categories
   * Each commit starts with a category,  
     :package: NEW:  
     :ok_hand: IMPROVE:  
     :bug: FIX:  
     :book: DOC:  
     :rocket: RELEASE:  
     :ballot_box_with_check: TEST:  
     :pretzel: REFACTOR:  
3. Actions
   * Each commit is based on actions you take
4. Spelling
   * Use proper spelling where possible
5. Capitalisation
   * The categories should be all UPPERCASE followed by a single colon : 
   * The first letter of the first word following the colon should be capitalised
   * Following letters should be all lowercase UNLESS  
     * A proper noun  
     * Referring specifically to filename, class, method, function or other specific part of the coded project  
  
No branches just origin/master unless you are willing to deal with the issues of branch merge directly

### Expected steps
 1. Add all files to local
 1. Commit directory/project to local
 1. Pull Remote
    1. Resolve Issues
    1. Re Commit Local
 1. Push Local to Remote
 
If there are any unexpected errors do communicate with rest of team when working.

### Do Steps When
 1. Before Work Starts
 1. Periodically
    1. Any significant changes
    1. Work on other Projects
    1. Return From Working on other projects
    1. Need to move away from keyboard
    1. Come back to working after being away
    1. Use your own judgement
 1. End of the day / When done with work

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
