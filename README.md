## Git Conventions

### Git Messages
Philosophy based off of [Emoji-Log: A new way to write Git commit messages](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/emoji-log-git-commit-messages)

1. Imperative
   * Commit messages should be imperative, like you are giving an order  
     :white_check_mark: **Add** instead of :x: **Added**       
     :white_check_mark: **Create** instead of :x: **Creating**
2. Categories
   * Each commit starts with a category,  
     :package: NEW:  
     :ok_hand: IMPROVE:  
     :bug: FIX:  
     :book: DOC:  
     :rocket: RELEASE:  
     :ballot_box_with_check: TEST:  
     :pretzel: REFACTOR:  
3. Actions
   * Each commit is based on actions you take
4. Spelling
   * Use proper spelling where possible
5. Capitalisation
   * The categories should be all UPPERCASE followed by a single colon : 
   * The first letter of the first word following the colon should be capitalised
   * Following letters should be all lowercase UNLESS  
     * A proper noun  
     * Referring specifically to filename, class, method, function or other specific part of the coded project  
  
No branches just origin/master unless you are willing to deal with the issues of branch merge directly

### Expected steps
 1. Add all files to local
 1. Commit directory/project to local
 1. Pull Remote
    1. Resolve Issues
    1. Re Commit Local
 1. Push Local to Remote
 
If there are any unexpected errors do communicate with rest of team when working.

### Do Steps When
 1. Before Work Starts
 1. Periodically
    1. Any significant changes
    1. Work on other Projects
    1. Return From Working on other projects
    1. Need to move away from keyboard
    1. Come back to working after being away
    1. Use your own judgement
 1. End of the day / When done with work
