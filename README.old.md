## Git Conventions
### Git Messages
Philosophy based off of [Emoji-Log: A new way to write Git commit messages](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/emoji-log-git-commit-messages)

1. Imperative
   * Commit messages should be imperative, like you are giving an order  
     :white_check_mark: **Add** instead of :x: **Added**       
     :white_check_mark: **Create** instead of :x: **Creating**
2. Categories
   * Each commit starts with a category,  
     :package: NEW:  
     :ok_hand: IMPROVE:  
     :bug: FIX:  
     :book: DOC:  
     :rocket: RELEASE:  
     :ballot_box_with_check: TEST:
3. Actions
   * Each commit is based on actions you take
4. Spelling
   * Use proper spelling where possible
5. Capitalisation
   * The categories should be all UPPERCASE followed by a single colon : 
   * The first letter of the first word following the colon should be capitalised
   * Following letters should be all lowercase UNLESS  
     * A proper noun  
     * Referring specifically to filename, class, method, function or other specific part of the coded project
